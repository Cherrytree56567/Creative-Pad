# July 31st: Created the Keys and the Microcontroller stuff!

I created a simple project in Easy EDA and I was able to create a bunch of mini parts for the microcontroller.
I was able to get a voltage converter which converted it from 5V to 3V3 for the RP2040. I also got some key switches and stuff in order. I plan to add a knob and a screen (KWH030ST11-F02) later on. Here is a picture of my schematic.

# August 1st: Added the Potentiometer and recreated stuff!

Turns out, you need to save in EasyEDA. I though it autosaved because it was an online program. Anyway, so I had to recreate most of the rp2040 stuff.
I also added a potentiometer and finished the rp2040 stuff. Im using the rp2040 [example](https://easyeda.com/editor#id=!757ac41db9974acda8ffcb7bf90f7860) on Easy EDA.
I didn't fully copy it (because you can't copy from std to pro) and I modified it a bit and did a bit of parts searching. I also organised it a bit.
