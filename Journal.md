# July 31st: Created the Keys and the Microcontroller stuff!

I created a simple project in Easy EDA and I was able to create a bunch of mini parts for the microcontroller.
I was able to get a voltage converter which converted it from 5V to 3V3 for the RP2040. I also got some key switches and stuff in order. I plan to add a knob and a screen (KWH030ST11-F02) later on. Here is a picture of my schematic.
